# GroceryList
A utility program I made my sophomore year which allowed you to place a spending limit, choose from lists of groceries, and then see/copy your grocery list.
To run the application, use the GroceryListRunner .bat file. It is a safe file, you can edit it to see what it does, it just runs the .jar file which was having trouble executing on it's own.
